## Alcatreize

NOTE: This is depreciated. (but i guess still works)

I'm currently working on another physics engine, written in pure C++. (will be ported to Godot soon after release)

The development should not take too long, but as I am currently in preparation class, I legit got 0 free time for projects (I couldn't even play a bit with Godot 4...).

Don't expect this next project to be ready before Summer 2025.
